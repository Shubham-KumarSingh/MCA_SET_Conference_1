MCA- SET-Conference_1

These are the essential files of the project.
If you want to import the tflite (TensorFlow Lite) trained output into the android or ios app.
Use these 2 files- i)converted_tflite and ii)converted_tflite_quantized

If you want to train the dataset yourself with different precision levels then use the images that I used for training the algorithm. All the images are availabe in TRAINING DATA SET IMAGES.
